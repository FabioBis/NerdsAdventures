New project Unit Packages Info

Character Controller :		Prefabs for inserting ready-made character controls for first or third person games. 
				Unless you're making an abstract game or puzzler this will probably be useful.

Light Cookies : 		A set of image masks used for lighting effects; 
				certainly not essential for a beginner project, but useful.

Light Flares : 			A set of textures for doing lens flare, sun glow etc. 
				Might be needed in some environments, not in others.

Particles : 			Contains a few example particles to get you started, handy in the majority of situations.

Physic Materials Scripts : 	Contains some example physical materials. 
				These are used in games that use the physics engine.

Skyboxes : 			Again, just some examples for you to use. Skyboxes are the backdrops for your game.

Standard Assets (Mobile) : 	Pretty self-explanatory, but if you're doing a mobile game you might find them handy. 
				If it's going to be just web/standalone, you won't be needing it.

Terrain Assets : 		Textures and such for the Terrain engine. 
				If your game doesn't use Unity's heightmap terrain system, you can leave it out. 
				Otherwise it's quite useful.

Toon Shading : 			Imports the cell-shader effect if you want to apply a cartoony look to your game. 
				Worth trying if you're curious
				(you can always delete any of these folders if you decide you don't need them anymore).

Tree Creator : 			Unity3's new tree creator, although I can't tell you much more as I haven't used it yet.
				But if your environment has trees, you might like to have it.

Water (Basic) : 		Includes a water effect, should your game require one.
